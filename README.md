# OutStem-FrontEnd-Challenge
The Challenge
The challenge is to build a Trivia game app, where users will be given multiple choice and true/false questions of increasing difficulty.

The design and layout of the website is totally up to you (feel free to use any UI libraries), though you will be judged on the look, feel, and usability of your application, so do your best to respect best practices in web design.

For this challenge, we will be using the Open Trivia Database API, which provides a list of random questions using the amount, difficulty, type, and category parameters.
